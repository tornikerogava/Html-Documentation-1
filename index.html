            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
            the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
            technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
            page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
            (JavaScript).
          </p>

          <p>
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
            either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
            fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
            and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an
            active participant in the World Wide Web.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
            display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements"
            such as:
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;head></code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;title></code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;head></code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;header></code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;footer></code></li>
          </ul>
            and many others.
          </p>

          <p>
            An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags",
            which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The
            name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can
            be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture of both.
          </p>

          <p>
            You don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at
            least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web
            passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You
            should have a basic work environment set up and understand how to
            create and manage files.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_Head">
          <header>HTML Head</header>
<p>The HTML head is the contents of the &lt;head>
   element — unlike the contents of the &lt;body> element 
   (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), 
   the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, 
   the head's job is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, 
   the head is quite small:</p>

<p><pre>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8">
    &lt;title>My test page&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  In larger pages however, the head can get quite full.
   Try going to some of your favorite websites and use the developer tools to check out their head contents.
    Our aim here is not to show you how to use everything that can possibly be put in the head, 
    but rather to teach you how to use the major elements that you'll want to include in the head, 
    and give you some familiarity. Let's get started.


</p>

<h2>Adding a Title</h2>

<p>
  We've already seen the &lt;title> element in action — 
  this can be used to add a title to the document. 
  This however can get confused with the &lt;h1> element,
   which is used to add a top level heading to your body content — 
   this is also sometimes referred to as the page title. But they are different things!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The &lt;h1> element appears on the page when loaded in the browser — 
    generally this should be used once per page, to mark up the title of your page content
     (the story title, or news headline, or whatever is appropriate to your usage.)</li>
  <li>The &lt;title> element is metadata that
     represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.)</li>
</ul>
